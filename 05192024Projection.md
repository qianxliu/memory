Projection

If you don't seek the dominance, you must not care the politics(so maybe politician is firstly centre-right).

So you probably seek to be a 
```
switch(directions):
{
  mathematic(center and left?):
    break;
  economics(right?):
    money first, calculating
    break;
  social influencer(right?):
    clown
    break;
  law(centre-left?):
    native social rules
    break;
  default(center-right?):
    seek the dominance
}
```
politician.
