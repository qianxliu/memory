If a journal is not public, so no one knows you writted a journal. And language.
If I used 中文 to write a journal, there must be always people who won't understand. 中文 this language has too much differences with other languages.
Or it's because of my personalities, from I was younger, I was accustomed to satisfying others. But indeed, I don't want to speak English but want to learn/live in other languages.
日本语 and Romance languages are indeed better(familiar), somehow. And Русский(But I don't understand it very well.)
Оппенгеймер learned two Germanic languages.
All in all, English is also a language which I'm forgetting. Now I still keep the memory, because I thought not everyone understands my native language.
But I think languages are easy. If you have an environment. Most Chinese don't speak 日本语, so when one day they went to the dreamed English lands. 

Indeed habits are the factors of many things. Such as I'm still speak English. Somehow if a Chinese want to live a happy life, maybe Romance languages and 日本语 are better. Because of the global situations.
All in all, this is just a journal from an Exception and current me. Still remembered when I read books at the library, 

I didn't pay attentions to making me individual thinking, which is all because of my life. Fate somehow. Fate.
Fate. Thought back when I was young, when I want to become a mathematician. But there were too many things, I finally settled on something. For it I even changed my habits.

So the individual thinking is not by accident. If one person was born to be good at mathematics, and by fate/force/something he learned the totally opposite subjects.
And before high school he somehow never got a 2rd rank in grades(But, this's not important). And he lost because he was driven/forced by something to become a different person.

Exams are not everything. If you failed, you will find originally a math 1st taked the other subjects, he will fail. Although he didn't fail so hard. But he didn't understand the exams.
For him, only math exams are the grades. Maybe he got a high score on a non math subject, but somehow he didn't really understand that. Maybe it's called fate? But fate is in his hands.

Maybe everyone should fail on the subjects they didn't really study. And keep on taking that. But the selection is existing in the education. So that's a problem.
You can get the really high scores without understanding subjects(In some cases in some countries, maybe you just need a good relation). You can understand the subjects without getting really high scores.
You also can understand the two different subjects. But you are not such a person. And, the understanding of one totally different subject may harm the original understanding.
The key problem is if you did this, then you are an Exception. So people can not evaluate you by common criterions.

Most people don't really like the people who are different with them. And because this is the social science, I don't think I can really compare the degrees.
Exception by somehow I called Fate. Actual me, maybe is just a dull, simple, introverted person who pursues the spirit of scientist.
Until now somehow I even don't know why did I fall in love with mathematics and programming. No one encouraged me.
I'm losing the original myself due to many reasons. And at least until now I don't want to keep this way.

Although this journal is English, I never spoke English to a real person. You also can not invent a language by yourself.
It's not good to live strangely. Not good.
