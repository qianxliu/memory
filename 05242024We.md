# I/We
So, I suggest everyone don't say bad things about the Asian(JCK) people. 

結果は自負する。

JCK also could be the real internationalists.

# 中文
我/我们(他/他们，她/她们)

# 日本語（にほんご）

们
「たち」敬体语感的后缀，可以用于别人，也可以用于自己
「ども」自谦式后缀，只能用于自己
「がた」敬语式后缀，只能用于敬长者
「ら」粗鲁式后缀，既可以用于别人，也可以用于自己。用在关系密切者之间，带有亲昵的语气；如果是用在上级对下级时，带有简慢的语气。
而「彼」「彼女」是日语模仿西欧语系创造出来的唯一的有性别的人称代名词，没有“近称、中称、远称”的区别。

# 한국인

Roman languages have the same features on the he/she.
Germanic languages have the same features on the you/you. 
German is a little different. German has the characteristics of both of the above.

# Conclusion

## Collective:

They, You, We：  JCK

They, You：  German, Slavic languages(Russian, Poland) (a little French on You(vous/vous))

They:  Roman languages(with genders, Italian)

You:  Germanic languages

Assume Romans(including French), Germanics(including German), Slavics, JCK as the four groups. And every speaker speaks only ONE language.

So, 

If I was a Japanese, MY opinion represents more all Japanese for Romans, French, Slavics, German, JCK. NOT for Germanics.

If I was a Russian speaking, MY opinion represents more all Russian for Romans, French, German, JCK. NOT for Germanics and Slavics.

If I was a French, MY opinion represents more all French for German, Slavics, French, JCK. NOT for Romans, Germanics.

If I was a Portuguese speaking, MY opinion represents more all Portuguese for German, Slavics, French, JCK. NOT for Romans, Germanics.

If I was an English speaking, MY opinion represents more all English for Germanics, Romans, German, Slavics, French, JCK(all!).

If I was a German speaking, MY opinion represents more all German for Germanics, Romans, German, Slavics, French, JCK(all!).

Arabic: YOU(tu: 'ant, vous: 'antum), and the THEY but has more genders.(il: hu, ils: hum, elle: hi, elles: huna)



Anyway, I(I) should stop writting the interesting myths about languages maybe.
