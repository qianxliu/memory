Connections

For someones, the applications are just trying to get an opportunity to test/interview. So if there's no connections, you must build some connections firstly.

So for random appliants, ChatGPT+Word is the God tool to get the opportunities for the self-centered people. Just need an opportunity.

But somebody also keep using the latex and original words but not try to match the "requirements" from a self-centered. So...the usages of knowledge are also important.

"I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain."
Scientist is just not an easy path.

If you quited the closest relations firstly, you must see the differences.

The usages of knowledge are also important.
