Two years past. He always dreamed the young him.

Although in the university he also didn't live so well, it was a consistent time. Went to library and spent whole day to learn everything. And math.
It's a pity that he didn't read the complex analysis. Or at that time he didn't reach that. But if he did that, did these things become more different?

Even real analysis is not suited to show random guys. And he read the OSTEP, introduction to algorithms, Knuth, and these helped him in any ways?

So somehow he always questioned himself. The reasons of learning.
Yeah, the reasons.

Learning is just for title? Or it does help yourself? In which ways?
English is useless, Reading books is useless. Title is useful. Connection is useful.

Vanity is the character of general people, in some environments.

Even reading a lot of books, even...
Reading somehow makes you more international. Also reading made people dreaming about a different world. Although, it doesn't help.
So now, people also don't read books. Because it's useless. Useless like him.
