We dream the future after 30000.

One day, this world will not have the U.S., Soviet, China. Maybe the new countries are called the Great United States, and the United Unions.

A group of political prisoners descendants of the ex the Great United States conquered the Mars, and called the new country as the United Mars. The Moon and the the United Unions condemn the Great United States because the Great United States frequently violates human(robot) rights. And in the 30980, Mars successfully united the Great United States. Mars becomes the biggest capital in the Solar system and human starts to explore the more.

For the humanity, we should sacrifice the past. How the achieve a great country but not harm the freedom of people(just like the principle: country is more powerful, the people are more weak?). The key is technology/science, the same goal and just update(just like: US > UK, Japan > China, Brazil > Portugal, Germany > Prussia, Simplified > Traditional, Israel > Palestine, Mexico > Spain, maybe, Ukraine > Russia).

Maybe one day the alien will let human achieve that early. So, it's the techology I dreamed in my young times. For the human beings!

I learned the history, but I loved the math more.
