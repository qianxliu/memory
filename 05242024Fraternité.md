> Actually this title should be Japanese or Chinese.  Fraternity(universal love) and Brotherhood are totally different in most Asian countries(may include Arabic).

> Base text is mainly English+Chinese, but Fraternity has two meanings in English such as brotherhood(shared with most Germanic/Slavic/Latin), so may the translations be not such completed in the first because such as in Japanese/Chinese, universal love is a single word.

> Philanthropy: The desire to promote the welfare of others, expressed especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. It's the humanity in the Spanish, Protuguese and French. In other Latins, it becomes more Divine.
