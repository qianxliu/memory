> Base text is mainly English+Chinese+French+others, because Fraternity has two meanings in English such as brotherhood(shared with most Germanic/Slavic/Latin), so may the translations be not such completed in the first because such as in Japanese/Chinese/Korean, universal love is a single word different with the brotherhood.

> Philanthropy: The desire to promote the welfare of others, expressed especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. Usually in Germanics.

> English(G): English(G) usually places the brotherhood meaning as the first.

This is normal. Such as Chinese, said the "国" like France, Germany, Korea, UK and US. But in English, they're (UK, US), France(Seems like France called it France), Germany, China.

The regrets are Chinese don't use the same words for Japan, Spanish, Portugul and Ireland.
